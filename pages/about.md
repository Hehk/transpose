Welcome to Transpose!

The goal of this project is to make a simple and easy to use AI art editor. I want to get you from idea to image as
quickly as possible!
This comes from playing with DALL-E for the last few days and always wanting to just make a little tweak here, a
little tweak there and spin up a beautiful image that can be shared with friends.

Right now, assume everything to be very unstable and open to change. I am hacking away and trying to test out ideas!
